<h1>VisionWalk: AR Indoor Navigation System </h1>

Abstract:  
The “VisionWalk” developed for college campuses using Unity AR Foundation presents an innovative solution to address the challenges of navigating complex indoor environments. By leveraging augmented reality technology and Unity AR Foundation's powerful features, the system offers an intuitive and efficient wayfinding experience for students, faculty, and visitors within the college premises. Through real-time localization and mapping techniques, dynamic routing algorithms, and seamless interaction with campus landmarks, the system enhances accessibility and improves navigation efficiency throughout the campus environment. 
 
Introduction:  
Navigating indoor environments, particularly in sprawling college campuses, can be a daunting task for students, faculty, and visitors alike. Traditional navigation methods often fall short in providing accurate guidance and orientation within complex indoor spaces. The AR Indoor Navigation System developed using Unity AR Foundation addresses this challenge by offering a user-friendly interface, accurate positioning through SLAM techniques, and optimized routing algorithms. By overlaying AR content onto the real-world environment, the system provides clear guidance and enhances the overall navigation experience within the college campus. 
 
Key Features: 
•	Enhanced user experience with intuitive navigation interfaces. 
•	Improved accuracy in navigation instructions through real-time localization. 
•	Optimization of navigation paths for efficient routing. 
•	Seamless interaction with campus landmarks and points of interest. 
•	Increased accessibility for individuals with disabilities. 
•	Time-saving solution for users navigating the campus. 
 
Technology Stack 
•	Unity AR Foundation for AR content creation and environmental understanding. 
•	Integration with existing campus infrastructure and systems. 
•	Development in programming languages such as C# for Unity development. 
•	Utilization of hardware components such as smartphones or tablets for AR display.
